## Introduction

Aquaponics is a sustainable method of food production that combines aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (growing plants in water). This project aims to elevate the sustainability of aquaponics systems through intelligent control systems. The automated system monitors and controls the environment to ensure optimal conditions, improving plant growth and fish health while reducing resource usage.

## Background

Aquaponics has been practiced for centuries, but modern technology allows for more efficient and sustainable systems. By integrating sensors, actuators, and intelligent control systems, we can create a closed-loop system that optimizes conditions for both plants and fish. This approach reduces water usage, improves productivity, and supports sustainable food production.

## Problem Definition

The problem is to develop an automated control system for aquaponics that optimizes conditions for plant growth and fish health. Manual monitoring and adjustment are time-consuming and often imprecise. The proposed system uses sensors and actuators to automatically adjust conditions, providing real-time data and control to enhance efficiency and sustainability.

## Objectives

- To design an intelligent control system for aquaponics.
- To automate monitoring and control of environmental conditions.
- To optimize water usage, plant growth, and fish health.
- To utilize data analytics for continuous improvement.

## Methodology/Procedure

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Sensor Integration**: Using sensors to monitor water quality, temperature, humidity, and light levels.
2. **Actuator Control**: Implementing actuators to adjust water flow, lighting, and nutrient delivery.
3. **Data Collection**: Collecting data from sensors for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
4. **Control System Development**: Developing algorithms for automated control based on sensor data.
5. **User Interface**: Creating an interface for users to monitor and control the system.
